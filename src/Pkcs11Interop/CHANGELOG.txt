Pkcs11Interop 3.1.0 (2016-03-29)
 - License changed to the Apache License, Version 2.0

   functions
 - Value of array attributes (e.g. CKA_WRAP_TEMPLATE and CKA_UNWRAP_TEMPLATE) 
   can now be read also in HighLevelAPIs
 - Fixed GetAttributeValue() method in HighLevelAPIs
 - Fixed marshaling of unmanaged CK_BBOOL type in C_GetSlotList() function

   C 'long' type is 4 bytes long and via LowLevelAPI80 and HighLevelAPI80 
   on platforms where C 'long' type is 8 bytes long
 - LowLevelAPI4 and HighLevelAPI4 known from previous versions support only 
   PKCS#11 libraries which are using structs packed with 1-byte alignment 
   on platforms where C 'long' type is 4 bytes long and therefore they have 
   been renamed to LowLevelAPI41 and HighLevelAPI41
 - LowLevelAPI8 and HighLevelAPI8 known from previous versions support only 
   PKCS#11 libraries which are using structs packed with 1-byte alignment 
   on platforms where C 'long' type is 8 bytes long and therefore they have 
   been renamed to LowLevelAPI81 and HighLevelAPI81
 - Multiplatform HighLevelAPI is now built on top of HighLevelAPI40, 
   HighLevelAPI41, HighLevelAPI80 and HighLevelAPI81 and it automatically uses 
   correct set of platform dependent APIs

   support only platforms where C 'long' type is 4 bytes long and they have 
   been renamed to LowLevelAPI4 and HighLevelAPI4

   and it automatically uses correct set of platform dependent APIs
