PKCS11-MOCK is minimalistic C library that implements PKCS#11 v2.20 API. 
It is not a real cryptographic module but just a dummy mock object designed 
specifically for unit testing of Pkcs11Interop library.

The Wikipedia article on mock objects states:

  In object-oriented programming, mock objects are simulated objects 
  that mimic the behavior of real objects in controlled ways. A programmer 
  typically creates a mock object to test the behavior of some other object, 
  in much the same way that a car designer uses a crash test dummy 
  to simulate the dynamic behavior of a human in vehicle impacts.

Following these simple principles PKCS11-MOCK does not depend on any hardware 
nor configuration and can be easily modified to return any response or data. 
It has been tested on several desktop and mobile platforms and as such might 
also be used as a lightweight skeleton for the development of portable 
PKCS#11 libraries.
